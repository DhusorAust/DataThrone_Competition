The journey of Mindsparks'19 started back in July 2018 when a bunch of enthusiasts and their mentors decided to take the club to a new height. We had no idea that such a prestigious institution such as IIT Roorkee of India would be collaborating with us to take things to the epitome of international levels and we are thankful to the organisers of cognizance, the second largest technical festival in Asia for the belief in us in spite of few hiccups. As per the memorandum between MindSparks,AUST and Cognizance, IIT Roorkee for the first time in the history of international Campus collaborations, 3 champion teams got the opportunity to take part in finals at Cognizance 19 and we are glad to let you know that out of the two teams that went to India,  1. Team Quibbler of Segment Technocad became Champions in Technocad in Cognizance 19. 2. SUST Cracker Nut/ Team Bangladesh became First runners Up in Cyborg Breaking Segment of Cognizance,19.  We thank the organisers of Cognizance for their unconditional accommodations and amazing event delivery along with welcoming Bangladesh to compete there, waving the registration and accommodation fees. We look forward to Such collabs in the future.   Cyborg Breakin team leader tonmoy says :   ""This competition was the first of my international competition! I tried to give my best and succeeded by the grace of Allah. If you want to know about the event, then I would say that their event is huge! And everybody knows what they have to do to make the event successful. Central management was good, but if I talk about professionalism, then here I will keep my MindSparks ahead.

In the very beginning SCM was discussed from an introductory level. The instructors highlighted more topics related to Inventory Management, Transportation, Warehouse Arrangement, Procurement, Logistics and such. There was a Q/A session in which several participants appeared to ask pretty good queries based upon hot topics which kept running till the end.      We acknowledge our greatest thanks to Mr. Md.

The virus is so contagious that it reached almost every corner of this planet and brought the whole world to a dead stop within in a matter of month.   The doctors are working under ginormous stress and looking after the affected people. In some occasions, doctors themselves are getting infected due to lack of adequate equipment. If the number of cases proliferates, the hospitals will be forced to turn away patients. The most adverse thing we can do right now is get ourselves infected. We can follow these few simple steps to prevent the virus from spreading:   - Avoid handshakes.  -Wash your hands with soap or alcohol-based hand rub for at least 20 seconds regularly. This kills viruses that may be in your hands. - Wear a mask and gloves when you are going outside. - Avoid crowdy places and maintain at least 1 metre distance between yourself and any other individual. If an infected person coughs or sneezes, they spray droplets containing the virus which you might breath in. - Isolate yourself if you have the slightest symptom of COVID-19.  #StayHome #StaySafe",Photo,2020-05-20 01:05:49,2294,3079,119,92,119,0,1737,1189,93,0,0,0,0,0,0
